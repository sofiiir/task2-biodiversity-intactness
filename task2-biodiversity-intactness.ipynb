    "\n",
    "In 2021, Maricopa County —home to the Phoenix metropolitan area— was identified as the U.S. county with the most significant increase in developed land since 2001. This rapid urban sprawl has profound implications for biodiversity and the health of surrounding natural ecosystems.\n",

    "In this assignment, you will investigate the impacts of urban expansion by analyzing a dataset that captures values for the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII). Your task is to examine changes in BII in the Phoenix county subdivision area between 2017 and 2020, shedding light on how urban growth affects biodiversity over time."
